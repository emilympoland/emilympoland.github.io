					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about how there are set design rules across entire companies in order to maintain visual continuity. I also learned about how whitespace maintains organization on a page. Additionally, I had not previously thought about the balance of using whitespace effectively while also fitting everything you need to onto the page. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was all of the picture examples they used in order to illustrate their points. The photos really helped me understand what they meant by white space and where it needs to go. The pictures demonstrating the consistent spacing were also very interesting. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe." </p>
						</li>
