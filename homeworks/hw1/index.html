            <li> I learned a lot about how your design can cater to your audience and their desires. 
                For example, how the author points out the 'Try London' in the searchbar on Airbnb and how that generates excitement for the user. </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this article was how the author broke down the Airbnb and Spotify apps in detail to show us how to break down the apps we use often to learn from them. 
                I really liked this visual that clearly explained what she was talking about and highlighted interesting design components that we should be aware of.</li>
            <li> "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
            <li> 10 :D</li>
          </ul>
