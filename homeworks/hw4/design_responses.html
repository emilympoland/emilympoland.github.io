					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I never knew that inaccessability on a website was something that you can actually sue someone for. However, when I thought about it, it totally does make sense. Like if the DMV website was not accessible or other ones that people need to use that would be messed up. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was when they explained exactly how to make a website accessible for people. I liked the color and contrast suggestions. I also liked how they emphasized using icons in addition to text. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
