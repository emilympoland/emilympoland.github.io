					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/hw 2 wire frames.jpg"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/hw 2 wire frames.jpg"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this website is to sell skis and ski gear, and it is intended for skiers. It accomplishes this by effectively using negative space to make sure the site is not overwhelming, featuring cinematic images of skiing to excite the buyer.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> As part of my redesign, I moved the search bar to be grouped with the categories like 'Men', 'Women', and 'Kids' in order to indicate that they are related because I thought that they should be categorized together. I also chose to just group the liked items button and view cart, and make them bigger because I found them hard to find. The main design principle I applied here was that items of the same size/shape are seen as related. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
