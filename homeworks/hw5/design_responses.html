                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I think that this article really emphasized how less is more when it comes to UI, but that does not mean you have to make something minimalist and boring. Each of these UIs had some of their own personality through animations and effects, while still looking clean. I like learning about how to incorporate personality into pages without sacrificing readbility. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really liked all of the visuals in the article. I know that the article was all visuals, but I really like to look at visuals like this one for inspiration for my own work and ideas. Looking at pretty pictures and animations is also always fun. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration from this article was Selected Works Transitions Experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk for Sochnik. I really liked this one because of the sort of pixelated effect their animations had. I also really liked this one because the color grading of the photos matched the white background really nicely. I also like how they used a serif font to add to the sort of sophisticated vibe of the page. </p>
