					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The main thing I learned from this article was the general rules to follow when using animations.
								I learned how to make motion convincing and avoid overwhelm with animations. This is extrememly helpful for when I try and use animations myself. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like how th earticle provides quantitative measures of what seems fast or slow after discussing the speed of an animation. 
								This really helped me conceptualize with an actual number. I think if I just tried to judge it myself I wouldn't get it quite right. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. These figures are based on the particular qualities of the human brain. Any animation shorter than 100 ms is instantaneous and wonâ€™t be recognized at all. Whereas the animation longer than 1 second would convey a sense of delay and thus be boring for the user." </p>
						</li>
